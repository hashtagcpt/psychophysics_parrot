# Psychophysics Parrot

Dead parrot psychophysics experiments ported from psychophysics and video toolboxes to Python

[*"No, no, he's not dead, he's, he's restin'!"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Parrot_sketch) 

1. This repository aims to house psychophysics experiments from MatLab and the Psychophysics and Video toolboxes (Brainard, 1997; Pelli, 1997; Kleiner et al., 2008) to Python. It arises from a problem I first encountered when beginning to program psychophysics experiments in the late 90s, where the papers I read used technology different from what was available. Today, porting is much easier with the availability of LLM, and this project uses that technology to produce the ports. 

2. Each experiment in this repository is not meant to be complete or correct but merely a minimal example of dead parrots (read: experiments) that are available to those interested. Errors could creep in from the original code, the translation, or elsewhere. Service and support for each Parrot will be poor and/or frustrating.

3. Please feel free to contribute or suggest experiments, especially pre-PTB3 experiments, that you believe would be useful.
