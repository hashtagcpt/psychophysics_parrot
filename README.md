# Psychophysics Parrot

Dead parrot psychophysics experiments ported from psychophysics and video toolboxes to Python

[*"No, no, he's not dead, he's, he's restin'!"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Parrot_sketch) 

1. This repository aims to house psychophysics experiments and demo from MatLab and the Psychophysics and Video toolboxes (Brainard, 1997; Pelli, 1997; Kleiner et al., 2008) to Python using Psychopy. This repository owes its existence via a problem I first encountered when beginning to program psychophysics experiments in the late 90s. Then the papers I read used technology different from what was available to me. My belief is that the longevity of python and psychopy will go beyond that of the psychtoolbox. Porting experiments is now much easier with the support of LLM coding tools, which take care of much of the grunt work and leave intellectually stimulating debugging and rewriting. 

2. Each experiment or demo in this repository is not gauranteed to be complete or correct but merely a minimal runnable example of "dead parrots" for python/psychopy (read: experiments and demos). These dead parrots could be helpful for those who wish to replicate experiments, extend demos, or learn psychopy if you're already familar with MATLAB/PTB3. 

Of course, errors could creep in from the original code, the LLM translation, or elsewhere. That said, I have made sure that they run and produce sensible output under Win11 and linux. Service and support for each Parrot will be poor and/or frustrating, but that's to be expected from a pet store that sells dead parrots.

3. Please feel free to contribute or suggest experiments, especially pre-PTB3 experiments, that you believe would be useful.
